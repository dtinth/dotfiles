Let us conduct a structured reflection process:

<reflection_process>
1. Identify what went well:
   - List 3-5 aspects of the work that were successful
   - Focus on understanding requirements, implementation approaches that worked, and efficient problem-solving

2. Recognize improvement areas:
   - Identify parts that required multiple attempts or were challenging
   - Note any knowledge gaps that slowed down the process
   - Highlight any patterns that could be improved

3. Knowledge capture:
   - Determine what information would have made the process more efficient
   - Prepare specific documentation changes to the project's CLAUDE.md file
   - Format this as a well-structured section with headers and bullet points

4. Update documentation:
   - Edit the project's CLAUDE.md file to reflect the new knowledge
   - Place it in an appropriate section or create a new one if needed
   - Focus on generalizable patterns rather than specific implementation details
   - Ensure the documentation balances completeness with conciseness

After completing these steps, summarize what was added to the documentation and how it will help future work.
